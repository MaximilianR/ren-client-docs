**For contract addresses, see [deployments](https://renproject.github.io/ren-client-docs/contracts/deployments/).**

These pages document the smart contracts that are apart of the Ren source base.
Ren's smart contracts are divided into two categories:

- **Darknode contracts**, responsible for darknode registration and fees
- **Gateway contracts**, for handling minting and burning of ren-assets.

The darknode contracts only exist on Ethereum, while the gateway contracts exist on the contract-based chains that RenVM supports.
The gateway contracts have been implemented for multiple smart-contract platforms. These docs will focus on the contracts written for the EVM.

The contracts can be found in the following repositories:

- Darknode contracts (EVM): <https://github.com/renproject/darknode-sol>
- Gateway contracts:
  - EVM: <https://github.com/renproject/gateway-sol>
  - Solana: <https://github.com/renproject/ren-solana>
  - Acala: _in development_
- Ren Solidity Template: <https://github.com/renproject/ren-solidity-template>
